### End-to-end scene text recognition in on-the-edge devices

 In this project we will research end-to-end scene text recognition architectures that are able in a single step to detect the relevant text from images and recognize it. Training-aware quantization techniques will be applied so that the network is able to operate on the integer domain for a later deployment on on-the-edge TPU devices
